            <br>Fallin' out, fallin' in
            <br>Nothing's sure in this world, no, no
            <br>Breakin' out, breakin' in
            <br>Never knowin' what lies ahead
            <br>We can really never tell it all, no, no, no
            <br>
            <br>Say "Goodbye", say "Hello"
            <br>To a lover or friend
            <br>Sometimes, we never could understand
            <br>Why some things begin, then just end
            <br>We can really never tell it all, no, no, no
            <br>
            <br>But, oh, can't you see
            <br>That no matter what happens, life goes on and on?
            <br>And so, oh, baby, just smile
            <br>'Cause I'm always around you
            <br>And I'll make you see how beautiful life is for you and me

        <p>
            <br>Take a little time, baby
            <br>See the butterflies' colors
            <br>Listen to the birds that were sent
            <br>To sing for me and you
            <br>Can you feel me?
            <br>This is such a wonderful place to be
            <br>
            <br>Even if there is pain now
            <br>Everything would be alright
            <br>For as long as the world still turns
            <br>There will be night and day
            <br>Can you hear me?
            <br>There's a rainbow always after the rain
            <br>
            <br>Oh, whoa
        </p>

            <br>Win or lose, you should go, yeah, yeah
            <br>Gettin' warm, gettin' cold
            <br>Weather could be so good or bad
            <br>But, baby, this is life now, don't get mad, no, no, no
            <br>
            <br>'Cause, oh, can't you see (can't you see?)
            <br>That no matter what happens, life goes on and on?
            <br>So, baby, please smile (just smile)
            <br>'Cause I'm always around you
            <br>And I'll make you see how beautiful life is for you and me

            <br>Life's full of challenges
            <br>Not all the time we get what we want
            <br>But don't despair, my dear (I know now)
            <br>You'll take each trial, and you'll make it through the storm
            <br>'Cause you're strong, my faith in you is clear
            <br>So, I'll say once again, this world's wonderful
            <br>And let us celebrate life that's so beautiful, so beautiful
